# Data Sources & Limitations

Completeness: While there are over 300 sites in Catalonia, many smaller, rural establishments do not maintain an independent website (marked as false per your requirement).

Registry Access: For the absolute complete list of all 350+ sites, the Generalitat de Catalunya maintains the "Registre de Turisme de Catalunya" (RTC).
