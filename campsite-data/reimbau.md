A Strategic Analysis of the Spanish Outdoor Hospitality Sector: Case Study of Camping Riembau, Platja d’AroHistorical and Macro-Economic Context of the Iberian Outdoor Hospitality MarketThe Spanish outdoor hospitality sector has experienced a profound shift from utilitarian camping grounds to high-value outdoor resorts, a transformation particularly evident in the Catalonia region. This evolution is driven by a combination of domestic investment and the rising expectations of a pan-European clientele. Within this context, Camping Riembau in Platja d’Aro serves as a benchmark for the industry’s "first-class" or four-star segment. The facility demonstrates how large-scale land management can be integrated with sophisticated service layers to create a resilient tourism product.Catalonia remains the primary driver of this innovation, often leading the Spanish market in occupancy rates and infrastructure investment. The province of Girona, and specifically the Costa Brava, attracts a demographic that seeks a blend of natural environment and high-end amenities. Camping Riembau exemplifies this by offering over 1,200 pitches and a significant inventory of rental bungalows, all managed within a framework of professional corporate governance under Turiscamp, S.A..The market’s resilience is rooted in its ability to offer variable price points and accommodation types, which cater to everyone from budget-conscious backpackers to luxury-seeking families in premium mobile homes. This versatility is critical in a post-pandemic travel economy where privacy and open-air environments are prioritised. As the sector moves towards the 2026 season, the emphasis on quality, hygiene, and personalised service has become the primary competitive differentiator.The Strategic Geography of Platja d’Aro and the Baix EmpordàPlatja d’Aro functions as a central node in the Costa Brava tourism ecosystem. The location of Camping Riembau within this municipality is strategic, providing guests with immediate access to both the natural beauty of the Mediterranean coast and the robust commercial infrastructure of a major town centre.Regional Connectivity and AccessibilityThe campsite’s accessibility is a core component of its operational success. It is positioned as a primary destination for international travellers arriving via multiple transport modes.InfrastructureDistanceStrategic ImportancePlatja Gran Beach1.0 kmCore recreational asset for guests Platja d'Aro Town Centre1.0 kmAccess to retail, dining, and local services Bus Station (Platja d'Aro)1.0 kmConnectivity for non-motorised tourists Girona-Costa Brava Airport30.0 kmPrimary hub for international low-cost carriers Barcelona-El Prat Airport116.0 kmPrimary hub for long-haul international flights Caldes de Malavella Station24.0 kmAccess to the regional and national rail network The proximity to major landmarks such as the Everest Costa Brava (0.5 mi) and Parc Aquàtic Aquadiver (1.4 mi) further enhances the site’s appeal to the family demographic, ensuring that external entertainment options are within walking or cycling distance.Climate and Environmental FactorsThe Baix Empordà region enjoys a Mediterranean climate that permits a long operational season, typically extending from late March to late September. However, the micro-climate is also influenced by the Tramuntana winds, necessitating the high levels of vegetation and "Mucha Sombra" (abundant shade) found at the Riembau site. The natural setting is characterised by golden sandy beaches and coves, which serve as the primary draw for the site's activities, including scuba diving, kayaking, and windsurfing.Technical Infrastructure and Land Use ManagementCamping Riembau occupies a total area of approximately 190,000 square metres (19 hectares), making it one of the largest hospitality footprints in the Platja d’Aro area. The management of such an expansive site requires a level of engineering and logistical planning that mirrors small-scale urban development.Topography and Site LayoutA defining characteristic of the Riembau grounds is the level, flat topography. This is a significant advantage for the outdoor hospitality sector, as it simplifies the parking and levelling of large motorhomes and caravans, many of which can exceed 5.5 metres in length. The grounds are meticulously divided into clearly marked pitches, separated by internal roads that are lit during the night for safety and security.The site is fenced entirely and features a 24-hour reception during the high season, supported by night guards and video surveillance. This high-security environment is essential for maintaining the "first-class" rating and ensuring the peace of mind of family guests.Zoning and Environmental ControlThe campsite utilises a strategic zoning model to manage guest density and amenity access. For example, specific sectors like Zone K are designated as pet-friendly, allowing the campsite to cater to the growing demographic of pet owners while maintaining pet-free zones in other areas, such as the bungalow sectors, to accommodate guests with allergies or different preferences.The vegetation consists of mature trees providing significant canopy cover, which is a vital technical requirement for Mediterranean campsites to mitigate heat during the peak months of July and August. This natural cooling is supplemented by the provision of free hot water in sanitary blocks and high-capacity electrical hook-ups across the pitches.Accommodation Tiering and Utility SpecificationsThe accommodation strategy at Camping Riembau is segmented into two primary categories: touring pitches for mobile units and fixed rental accommodations (bungalows and mobile homes).Pitch Specifications and Technical UtilitiesRiembau offers one of the largest pitch inventories on the Costa Brava, with approximately 1,200 plots. These are not uniform but are tiered based on size and utility access.Pitch CategoryArea (m²)ElectricityWater AccessPrivate FacilitiesStandard Plot96 m²5A / 10A Shared tap nearbyNoSuperior Plot128 m²12A / 15A Direct water tapNoComfort Plot128+ m²15A Direct water tapPrivate WC & Shower The provision of 15A (approximately 3,300W) electrical connections on Comfort and Superior plots is a high-end feature, allowing guests to run multiple modern appliances, including air conditioning units and electric cooking hobs, without tripping the circuit. Furthermore, the introduction of the "Comfort Plot" with its own private WC and kitchen module addresses a growing market demand for "hybrid camping," where guests enjoy the freedom of their own caravan but with the privacy of a hotel bathroom.Modular Architecture: The Bungalow and Mobile Home InventoryThe rental accommodation sector consists of between 64 and 100+ units, depending on the season and recent renovations. These units are designed to maximise internal living space while providing an "outdoor" feel through integrated porches and canopies.ModelArea (m²)PaxRoomsKey FeaturesLuxury 544 m²53Air-con, TV, Premium furnishings Gaudí42 m²42Air-con, large terrace Luxury 432 m²42Air-con, modern aesthetic Miró35 m²42Available in accessible versions Premium 534 m²53Optimized for larger families Standard28 m²42Essential comfort, 1 double + 2 single beds These units represent a significant portion of the site's revenue and are managed with a focus on hygiene and quality maintenance. Most units are pet-free, with the exception of specific rental types or zones, maintaining a high standard of cleanliness for all guests.Aquatic Leisure Systems and Wellness InfrastructureFor a four-star campsite in the Costa Brava, the aquatic facilities are often the primary differentiator. Riembau has invested heavily in a diverse water zone that caters to multiple age groups and seasonal requirements.The Outdoor Pool ComplexThe centrepiece of the recreational offering is an outdoor pool complex measuring approximately 1,400 square metres. This area includes:Adult Pool: Designed for recreational swimming and water-based animation.Children’s Pool: A shallow area for supervised play.Toddlers' Pool: A dedicated safe zone for ages 1-3 with a depth of less than 40 cm, covering 36 m².Waterpark Features: Including slides and interactive elements to engage the youth demographic.The pool area is surrounded by a solarium and garden, providing ample space for relaxation. Reviews consistently highlight that despite the high volume of guests, the pool area rarely feels overcrowded due to its sheer scale.The Heated Indoor Facility and Wellness ServicesUniquely, Riembau also provides a 312 m² heated indoor pool. This facility is a critical strategic asset as it allows the campsite to maintain its appeal during the cooler shoulder seasons in March, April, and late September. The indoor area is often associated with the site's wellness offering, which includes a sauna, whirlpool, and steam bath (available for an additional charge), positioning the campsite as a year-round "health and leisure" destination.Gastronomy, Retail, and the On-Site Commercial EcosystemThe economic model of Camping Riembau is not solely dependent on pitch and rental fees; a significant portion of revenue is generated through its internal commercial ecosystem.Gastronomic DiversityThe campsite offers a comprehensive food and beverage service that covers various dining styles:Full-Service Restaurant: Offering a menu that highlights Mediterranean and international cuisine, accessible via level ramps for disabled guests.Poolside Bar and Grill: Catering to the high-volume lunch and afternoon demand with snacks, grilled meats, and refreshments.Ice Cream Parlour: A popular amenity during the peak summer months.Takeaway Service: A highly professionalised service allowing families to enjoy prepared meals at their own pitch, a key trend in the outdoor sector.Retail and Essential ServicesThe on-site supermarket is a core infrastructure component, providing an "extensive selection" of groceries that reduces the need for guests to travel into the town of Platja d’Aro. The supermarket includes a bakery with fresh daily bread and international press, ensuring that long-stay guests from the UK, Germany, and the Netherlands have access to their preferred products.Additional commercial services include:Hairdresser: Providing on-site grooming services.Launderette: Equipped with washing machines and dryers.Rental Hub: Allowing guests to hire refrigerators, bicycles, mountain bikes, electric bikes, and even cars directly on-site.Sociographic Analysis: The Family Tourism FocusCamping Riembau has explicitly focused its marketing and operational efforts on the family tourism segment. This is evidenced by its attainment of the "Hola, Família!" seal from the Catalan Tourist Board, a certification that requires rigorous adherence to child-friendly service standards.Animation and the "Club Rimbi"The animation programme is a cornerstone of the guest experience, particularly during the high season (July and August). The "Club Rimbi" offers workshops, games, and sports for children, conducted in multiple languages including Spanish, English, French, and Dutch. This multilingual approach is essential for a campsite where over 50% of the guests are typically international.Inclusivity and AccessibilityThe campsite demonstrates a high degree of digital and physical maturity regarding accessibility. It is described as "accessible and partially adapted" for guests with reduced mobility. This includes level entrances to the supermarket and restaurant, adapted sanitary facilities in the main blocks, and the availability of specifically designed "Miró Accessible" bungalows.Revenue Management and 2026 Fiscal StrategyThe pricing structure for the 2026 season reflects the dynamic nature of the Costa Brava hospitality market. The season is bifurcated into distinct periods with significantly different price points for both adults and accommodation units.Pitch and Personnel Pricing (2026)Pricing is calculated based on a base rate for the pitch plus a per-person charge for each guest.Date RangeAdult (Per Night)Child 3-10 (Per Night)96 m² Plot128 m² Plot+128 m² Comfort28/03 - 29/05€4.60€2.55€23.70€30.50€72.0029/05 - 10/07€8.00€4.10€38.10€48.50€90.0010/07 - 23/08€11.30€6.70€54.00€70.00€111.2523/08 - 13/09€8.00€4.10€38.10€48.50€90.0013/09 - 27/09€4.60€2.55€23.70€30.50€72.00Source: Official 2026 Rates for Camping Riembau.For a standard base configuration of two adults on a 96 m² pitch during the lowest season, the combined rate is €32.90 per night (€23.70 for the plot and €9.20 for the two adults). This rate increases to €76.60 during the peak summer window in July and August.Long-Stay Discounting and the ACSI EffectTo manage occupancy during the shoulder seasons, Riembau employs an aggressive tiered discounting system for consecutive nights. These promotions are designed to attract the "silver surfer" demographic—retired European motorhome owners who travel for extended periods.7 consecutive nights: 10% to 20% discount.14 consecutive nights: 30% discount.21 consecutive nights: 40% discount.Furthermore, the campsite’s participation in the ACSI CampingCard scheme allows cardholders to access a fixed low-season rate of €25.00 per night, which typically includes two adults and a standard pitch with electricity. This participation is a key volume driver for the campsite during the months of April, May, and September.Corporate Governance and Digital AssetsCamping Riembau is owned and operated by Turiscamp, S.A., with its official fiscal address located at Santiago Rusiñol s/n, 17250 Platja d'Aro. The company is registered with the Registration Number KG-000027, signifying its compliance with the strict tourism regulations of the Generalitat de Catalunya.Digital InfrastructureThe campsite’s digital strategy is focused on ease of booking and on-site connectivity.

On-site, the WiFi network provides coverage to over 70% of the territory, a critical requirement for modern guests who often blend leisure with remote work.

Conclusion: Future Resilience and Competitive PositioningThe analysis of Camping Riembau reveals a facility that is well-positioned to navigate the evolving landscape of European tourism. By investing in high-end pitch utilities (15A power and private sanitary modules) and diverse aquatic facilities, the campsite has successfully insulated itself from the more commoditised lower-tier market.
